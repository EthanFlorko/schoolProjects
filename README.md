# schoolProjects
A display of various school projects ranging from Python, Java I, II, and C.

Hello! This repository is a showcase of various school projects completed throughout my different quarters at Eastern Washington University. The majority of assignments showcase a brief understanding of certain aspects of programming, some being beginner friendly, and the others being intermediate or higher. Although most of these programs are simplistic, they get the point across that I know how to implement certain aspects of code to create functional, clean code.

Most projects showcased are ultimately in Java, because that's what I've had the most experience with so far in my schooling. My python projects are extremely simple, and more so have an understanding of how to implement within the syntax correctly. Again, I am still in the process of learning, which means I'm open to other languages as well to expand my understanding of syntax amongst other languages. The projects included in this repository are within the last year and half at my time here at EWU.

Hopefully to whoever is reading this will get a decent understanding of what I'm capable of, but also what I could be. Knowing the basics of programming is a feat itself, the real trouble comes with applying it in the workforce. Although I am considered an intermediate coder, my determination to become and expert is growing ever so fast. The passion I hold for programming something I hold close to me, as it has the potential to change lives and make the world a better place. Please contact me if you have any questions.
